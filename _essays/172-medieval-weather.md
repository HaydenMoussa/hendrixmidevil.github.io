    <p>Weather plays a vital role in this letter and in medieval life. The premise of this crime revolves around playing in the snow, and this wouldn’t be possible if this didn’t happen at a specific time. Information about weather comes from not only written sources such as this letter but also from nature itself. Rings on trees inform historians and naturalists about huge weather spikes and changes throughout the tree’s life. During the medieval era, snowfall only occurred during January. December was extremely cold and dry, and peasants began returning to work in February. This would be one of the only times le Rat could play in the snow since it was the only month snowfall was likely. </p>

    <p>Additionally, cold weather made survival even harder for people of the medieval era. It was difficult to simply stay warm. Houses were poorly insulated, and people had to wear their thick clothes at all times, whether they were going outside or staying in their homes. If people had money during this time, they could line their clothing with fur to help keep heat in, but most people would either pad with felt or just wear multiple layers. The cold also killed many people who just couldn’t stay warm enough. Weather could determine life or death for many people living during the medieval era. </p>
