  <p>In the Middle Ages, being a wife was difficult; so was being a mother. In the Good Wife's Guide, there is a section dedicated to motherhood. All wives were expected to become mothers. All aspects of child rearing were left up to the mother. The knowledge and fears about childbearing and raising children all stemmed from women, as the husbands were expected to continue working.</p>
  <p>However, some mothers had to return to work for the family if they were of middle or lower class. Conflict arose between wives and husbands in this scenario, especially if the husband accused the wife of neglecting her duties as a mother. This is evident when Huguecte is accosted by her husband for abandoning her children and wishing they were toads. Other than being a faithful wife, motherhood was the most important job for Medieval women.</p>
