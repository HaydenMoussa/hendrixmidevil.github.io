    <p>In this letter, Pierre le Rat and his friends are play outside in the snow. While this playing eventually leads to the death of le Rat, this letter depicts aspects of medieval childhood. Firstly, childhood experiences from the medieval era look pretty similar to experiences from today. Children had toys that were played with and beloved. Hobby horses, doll houses, toy soldiers, and checker pieces are some of the surviving childhood toys. Children had time to play with one another and find joy within their daily lives. However, the largest difference between medieval childhood and contemporary childhood centers around schooling. Most medieval children did not attend school. A child of a high class may have a private tutor, but this would be reserved for male children. Children of artisans or workmen would typically learn the trade that their parents practiced, and the shop would be passed down generationally. Children were also extremely important when it came to peasant life: they were able to help maintain the land. They could work and help with the family’s trade. Children provided work within the family while also getting to experience the joy of play.  </p>
