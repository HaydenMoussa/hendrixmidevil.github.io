    <p>In the letter, Jehannette tries to overwrite the manâ€™s free will to get him to fall in love with her. During this time, free will was a problem that was divided into two categories: theological and a more rational perspective. Free will, through the theological perspective, was viewed as God giving people free will, having the capacity to either do good or evil5. In the case of the love potion, it would be viewed as Jehannette not only committing a sin by partaking in what can be considered witchcraft, but also attempting to violate someone else's free will.</p>
