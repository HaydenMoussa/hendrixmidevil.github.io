    <p>Women in the Middle Ages were expected to be fully devoted to their husbands, and fully devoted to God. A publication called the Good Wife's Guide began as a collection of advice, personality traits, and duties of a good Parisian wife. The three main concerns were morality, domestic life, and hosting. The wife's goal was meant to be a "moral, obedient, and attentive wife." When Huguecte left her husband, one of the reasons he gives for being so angry at her is that she went to stay with other men in the Hôtel.</p>
    <p>In addition, women who were married were expected to have children and raise them. These expectations were ingrained in all social aspects of the Middle Ages. There was an emphasis on monogamy and chastity in order for wives to please their husbands and God.

Husbands had the upper hand in the relationship, and often had legal privileges if he did not approve of his wife's behavior.</p>
