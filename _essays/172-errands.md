    <p>The reason Terry left his home on this snowy day was to run a few errands. In the medieval era, there were three main types of retail activity. Someone may be buying produce from a market stall. This produce would, obviously, feed them for the entire week; it’s a vital errand for people to complete. Customers may also be buying manufactured goods from an artisan at a shop or stall. If someone required robes, baskets, silks, medicines, and more, an artisan would be the one to provide these products. Finally, customers with more money could be buying products from a merchant. A merchant would sell more luxury items, but this was still an option for some during this time. Customers could either use coins to pay for these products, or they might barter with sellers depending on their occupation.  </p>
