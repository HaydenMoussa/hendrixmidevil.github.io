    <p>While Pierre Terry was running errands, he used a stick with three-pointed iron tips on the bottom. Most images from this period depict abled-body people going about their lives. However, there are many depictions of people utilizing mobility aids to move around. Many depictions show people using aids such as a walking stick or a crutch. There are also images that include complex mobility aids. One image from a 13th century manuscript depicts a man using “hand trestles” to move around.1 With these trestles, the man “would have used [them] to raise his upper body onto his hands and pull himself forward.”2 Other images show people with artificial limbs and supports for amputations. People living within this time, just as in our own, used mobility aids to be able to do the everyday tasks. Aids helped them to move around the world, and communities or religious groups would support disabled individuals who were unable to work. Mobility aids, in the medieval era and today, allow for people to access the world when physical limitations prevent it.  </p>
