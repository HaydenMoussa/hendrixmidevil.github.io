    <p>Love in the late Middle Ages was not always viewed as “romantic” as we know it now. It was often seen as violent, as seen with the Siege of the Castle of Love3. It depicts knights fighting their way into a castle, while the women in the castle are throwing roses at said knights. On the contrast, there were a few paintings depicted that showed a man giving his heart to a woman, which is referred to as courtly love. Courtly love was the idealized romantic relationship between two people, more specifically, it involved a man of good character, and serving his beloved. In this case, the love shown in the letter would be more of a siege of love, since the man mentioned had no desire for Jehannette, and Jehannette willing to use more forceful tactics to win him over without consent.

    <p>Another aspect that is intriguing is that in the letter, it makes a brief mention of sorcery, specifically, in reference to the strange object wrapped in silk. Sorcery, and magic in general, was generally frowned upon and would often be used as a scapegoat for certain kinds of people, often linked with witchcraft4. In this instance, we can see that even though Jehannette actively used the item to make the man fall in love with her, the guilt is put on Bon Jour. Showing that those who actively participated in magic are more likely to have the punishment fall upon them. </p>
