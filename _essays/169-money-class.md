    <p>Husbands were expected to be the bread winners of their households. They were the entire financial security for their wives in the Middle Ages. This ideal continued into the social expectations of marriage. Men were supposed to marry women who were of the same social class in order to avoid unnecessary disagreements. A man's honor was tied directly to his ability to provide for his family. Sometimes, wives would abandon their husbands if they felt they were not being taken care of. This was a blow to both of their honors.</p>
    
    <p>The 100 years' war was also occurring at this time. This war heavily affected peasants in Paris. These wars destroyed crops, homes, and livelihoods of many low-class workers in the area. For this reason, many worked less than they may have needed in order to make a living.</p>
