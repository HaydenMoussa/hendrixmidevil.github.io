    <p>As a part of Terry’s pardon, he had to make a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Boulogne. There was a belief that pilgrimage would allow the pilgrim to repent and grow from the experience of traveling. Pilgrims would don specific robes and hats, and they would use a walking stick for their journey. Depending on the severity of the crimes, criminals would have to make a pilgrimage to specific churches with specific religious associations. Distance and holiness were all considered when it came to dictating where someone would have to make their pilgrimage to. When pilgrims eventually reached their end destination, they were given specific broaches called Pilgrim Badges. These badges were worn for a time and then thrown into rivers as a vow. These broaches could either be a sign of devotion to God, or they could also help with other ailments, such as warding off disease. It’s unclear whether Terry ever made his pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Boulogne, but if he did, his journey would have been arduous as a way to repent for the killing of le Rat.   </p>
