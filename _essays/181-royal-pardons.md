    <p>Guilloten serves as an example of how pardon letters were not always about finding ways to legally judge guilty or innocent but could be about restoring the social standard, as argued by Arnade and Prevenier. King Charles VII was not saying Guilloten was innocent by pardoning her. She clearly burned down a building. Instead, he was attempting to restore the social structure that had been broken by Guilloten as well as Lavau. By removing the focus from the arson to a dispute of marriage, it becomes a social problem.</p>
    <p>These documents were a political method for kings to show a form of mercy and demonstrate their power by circumventing legal procedures. Pardon letters give the conflict a resolution while keeping the power of the king above all.</p>
