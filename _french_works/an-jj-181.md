<p>Poiron Guilloten for having burned down the home of the man who spurned her  
Charles by the grace of God King of France We make known to all present and to come we have received the humble supplication of Poiron daughter of Pierre Guilloten living in Lire in our country of Berry currently detained as a prisoner in our prisons of Bourges containing that a year and a half ago or thereabouts one named Jehan Lavau requested and chased her very strongly to have sex with her the which thing the said supplicant refused to do and did not want to do nor consent to. Nevertheless for the great pursuit that the said Lavau did to her and through the friendship that he promised her to take her as a wedded wife she consented to it, after the which promise and means this the said Lavau had sex with her and such that she became pregnant. The which feeling herself pregnant and with child, in order to avoid her dishonor and slander of her father and mother and others of her family and friends and in order to cover her deed many times requested the said Lavau that he wished to marry her as he had promised her. He refused to do this and did not want to do it, so the said supplicant was slandered and the said case was seen because she appeared pregnant and gravid and because of this she was blamed by her family and others. She, seeing herself blamed by her family and others the which supplicant seeing herself also slandered and dishonored and that the said Lavau did not want to marry her was very upset and discouraged and she being thus discouraged thought and took herself to find a manner to do harm and displeasure to the said Lavau and in order to put into execution her will the day of Saint Jehan the Evangelist last past around nightfall left the hostel of her father and mother and went to the place of Marmaigues to the hostel where the said Lavau lived and thinking that the said hostel was his, which it was not at all and he did not have anything except a small part and portion of it, in order to bring damage to him and thinking to revenge herself of the dishonor that the said Lavau had done to her started a fire in the said hostel such that the said hostel burned and was inflamed and many goods being in it. The which damage one estimates at the sum of twelve to fifteen pounds tournois or thereabouts. Because of which act the said supplicant was taken by the prevôt of the said place of Marmaignes and imprisoned in which prisons she confessed the said case and there has stayed for a long time. The which Lavau since the imprisonment of the said supplicant has confessed that he had done wrong to her in covenanting with the said supplicant and has promised to her family and friends to marry her if it would please us to remit and pardon the offense and case abovesaid for which she is at present detained prisoner in our said prisons at Bourges in which she is very enormously detained in great poverty and misery and likely to finish her days miserably if our grace and mercy is not imparted upon her for this, humbly requesting that considering that which is said and that by the refusal to marry her that the said Lavau had done to her and that she saw that she was dishonored and was so very troubled that she wanted to be dead and that she did not know well what she was doing and did not commit the said case with the intention to damage anyone other than the said Lavau and that she thought that the hostel was his and that by anger and heat she committed the said act and that it is a thing if she that of woman and ease that the present methods are not in the power of man nor of women and that in other cases she has always been of good reputation and renown and of honest conversation never having been accused or convicted of any other evil act, blame, or reproach it would please us to impart to her our said grace. Because of which we, considering that which is said, wishing to prefer mercy to the rigor of justice, have in the said case remitted, acquitted, and pardoned and by the tenor of these present by our special grace, full power, and Royal authority, we remit, acquit, and pardon the deed and act abovesaid with all punishment, fine, and offence, corporal, criminal, and civil in which the said supplicant on the occasion abovesaid could have incurred against us and Justice. And we have restored and restore her to her good reputation and renown in the country and to her goods not confiscated. Satisfaction made to the party civilly only if it is not done. And on this we impose perpetual silence on our procurer. So given in commandment by these same present to the bailli of Berry of Saint Pere le Moustier Prevot of Bourg and to all our justices or to their lieutenants present and to come et to each of them as appertains to him that by our present grace, acquittal, remission, and pardon the said supplicant make and allow neither in goods in any manner but her said body so detained as is said and her said goods if they were seized, arrested, or impeded for this, be given or had given to her immediately and without delay to full deliverance. And so that this will be a firm and stable thing forever, we have had placed our seal on these present. Except always in other things our right and to the other in everything. Given at Mont Richart in the month of January the year of grace 1452 and of our reign the 31st. So signed by the King at the relation of the counsel. Visa contentor P Aude </p>

<p>Poiron Guilloten, daughter of Pierre Guilloten, was sent to prison in Bourges, France for burning down the house of Jehan Lavau in Marmaigues. A year and a half earlier, Lavau had been aggressively pursuing Guilloten for sex, moves that were refused, but after promising to marry her, Guilloten became pregnant. Lavau then refused to marry her. Worried about dishonor from her family and community, Guilloten set the hostel Lavau lived in on fire as an act of revenge. She thought that Lavau owned the hostel, but he only rented a small section.</p>
<p>The fire caused significant damage, worth twelve to fifteen pounds tournois. Lavau later admitted that he did not follow his word and promised he would marry Guilloten if the king pardoned her. The King said that “she did not know well what she was doing” when she committed the crime, explaining that she only meant to harm Lavau and not the other renters or the owner of the hostel. This pardon helped restore Guilloten’s reputation by helping her reinstate herself in the community. \</p>
