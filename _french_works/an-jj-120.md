<p>Charles etc. We make known to all present and to come to us has been exposed on the part of Jehannette de Lospital otherwise of Lyon, poor linen draper living in Paris. That as before she had gone to see a Jew named Bon Jour living in the said place in order to borrow some money that she needed and because at the time she felt a great illness and sorrow in her head she asked for a remedy from the said Jew who practiced medicine and this Jew having told her that she should bring him her urine, she brought it to him the next morning the which seen by the said Jew he asked her if she was married and she said no. And then the said Jew told her that she was very much in love with a man and she told him that it was true that she was and that she loved one more than any other and that she wanted him to marry her even though he had never given her any hope but it seemed to her that he had become cold towards her. After which the said Jew told her that if she wanted to pay him well he would teach her something that was worth it through which she could come to her intention so that if she took it with her she would never have poverty. Therefore she, desiring to come to the state of marriage in order to achieve the creation of that joining she, as the simple woman that she was and is, at the words of the said Jew made a deal with him for four francs of gold in order to have this from him and in the meantime she gave him a belt of hers as a guarantee. And the said Jew gave her a little bit of something enveloped and contained in silk [cendal] without her seeing what it was and he said to her that she should carry it on her in the area of her stomach when she would join the said man that she loved contained and she would come to her intention but it never happened that she did it even though the said Jew had organized and taught her nevertheless she did not at all marry the said man but instead he married another who is still living and stays with him. For the which deed the said exposant is at the moment in our Chatelet of Paris and fears to be pursued by the rigor of justice for this if by us is not given to her grace. As we have been humbly supplicated that considering that before she had never meddled in the said sorcery but only gave her consent as a simple person by the suggestion of the said Jew that the thing had no effect nor any evil that came from it by the grace of God and that never before had she been accused or apprehended for any villainous deed, we would wish to give to her the said grace. Therefore we, having compassion on the said Jehannette in this party for consideration of the things above said, to the said Jehannete we have in the case abovesaid acquitted, pardoned, and remitted, acquit, pardon, and remit by our Royal authority and special grace through these present the deed abovesaid and all that which could come with all penalty, criminal, corporal, and civile that she could have incurred for this cause. And we return her to her good reputation and renown and to her goods not confiscated. And we impose on this to our procurer and to all other officers perpetual silence. Except for the right of the party if there is any to pursue her only civilly.. So given in commandment to the Prevot of Paris and to all others of our justices and officers present and to come or to their lieutenants and to each one of them as appertains to him that by our present grace they have and allow the said Jehannete to peaceably enjoy and use. And against the tenor of this they neither have impeded nor allow to be impeded in any manner but if any thing is done against or any of her goods are or were taken, seized, or arrested for this, give or have given to their original state and due. And her said goods and her body for this taken as is said to full deliverance as soon as these letters are seen. So that this may be a firm and stable thing forever We have had placed our ordinary seal in the absence of the Great ~ Except our law in other things and the other in everything ~ Given in Paris in the month of February ~ The year of grace 1381 And the second of our reign ~ </p>

<p>Jehannette de Lospital, a poor linen draper living in Paris, was searching for a Jewish doctor going by the name of Bon Jour. She asked to borrow some money that she required, as well as something to ease her the sorrow and illness that affected her. Later, Jehannette was asked if she was married, to which she said no, but admitted that she was in love with another man that gave her little to no attention. Bon Jour claimed that he could help her for the right price, and after payment, gave her an unknown object wrapped in silk and instructed her to place it on her stomach, claiming that her desires would come true. However, the man did not marry, instead he married someone else.</p>
<p>However, because Jehannette has never practiced sorcery before, only giving consent to Bon Jour, as well as nothing harmful coming from this situation, she was later pardoned and absolved from this deed. If any goods were taken from her, or if anything was done against her will, Jehannette was to be compensated accordingly and have all her items returned to her as soon as possible. </p>
