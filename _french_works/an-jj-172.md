<p>Henry by the grace of God King of France and of England. We make known to all present and to come that we have received the humble supplication of Pierre Terry tailor living in Fauquembergue.</p>
  <p>Containing that around the day of Saint Maur that was the 15th day of January 1422 last past, the said supplicant had gone to the said town of Fauquembergue here and there for some of his errands, on the which day there was a great fall of snow on the ground and it was very icy and greatly cold.</p>
  
  <p>And so as the said supplicant came back from the said town of Closquans into the said town of Fauquembergue the said day of Saint Maur he was very sick an ill in his person both by the coldness of the weather and otherwise, holding in his hands a stick which he had, high with three pointed iron tips to help him to go along the road.</p>
  
  <p>And when he came to one of the streets of the said town of Fauquembergue, he found many people and children who were throwing the said snow one to the other. It happened that one named Pierre le Rat, son of Jehan le Rat of the said town of Faquembergue who held in his hands a wooden shovel with which he threw the said snow at many people who passed and such that he spoke with many others ahead of the said supplicant crying in a loud voice that he would strongly throw some snow on the said supplicant.</p>
  
  <p>To whom this supplicant said and requested that they leave him in peace and that he was not at all at ease and that he was not interested in their games. And nevertheless the said Pierre le Rat threw with the said shovel that he had some snow on the said supplicant, and sought strongly to throw more on him.</p>
  
  <p>The said supplicant put and threw his said stick in front of the said shovel that the said Pierre held such that he hit this Pierre, and so continuing to do this the said supplicant attained one hit with his said iron stick as is said above in the head of the said Pierret le Rat such that one of the said pointed tips entered into the head of the said Pierret such that he had a blood and a wound of the said blow.</p>
  
  <p>And the wound thus made, by being badly attended and taken care of by medicine or otherwise grew ~~ the said wound and such that the said Pierre went to his sick bed and at the end of 15 days after or thereabouts he went from life to death.</p>
  
  <p>For the occasion of the said deed and act abovesaid the said supplicant, doubting the rigor of justice, left the country to which he dares never return, and fears that because of his absence he may be called to our law of the said place of Fauquembergue by some quinzaines. For which he would be likely to be forever more destroyed and alone if our grace and mercy were not to be imparted to him.</p>
  
  <p>In humbly requesting us that since the said supplicant has always been and is of good life, renown, and honest conversation without ever before having been taken for any other villainous act or blame and that the said act came about due to hot blood, not thinking to injure him so and that the said supplicant has made peace and satisfaction to the friends of the said dead man, we wishing to impart our said grace and mercy to him.</p>
  
  <p>For which we these things considered wishing mercy to be preferred to the rigor of justice, to the said supplicant in the case abovesaid have acquitted, remitted, and pardoned, we acquit, remit, and pardon by our special grace, full power, and royal authority by these present the act and deed abovesaid together with all punishment, offense, and fine corporal, criminal, and civil which for the deed and occasion abovesaid he can and could for this have incurred against us and justice.</p>
  
  <p>And we restore and replace him to his good reputation and renown in the country and to his moveable goods and inheritances not confiscated. Satisfaction given to the other party civilly if it is not done. And we impose silence on our procurer as long as the said Pierre makes a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Boulogne.</p>
  
  <p>So given in commandment by these present to the Bailli of Amiens, to the Prev√¥t of Monstereuil sur la Mer and to all our other justices and officers present and to come or to their lieutenants and to each one as appertains to him, that by our present grace remission and pardon make, suffer, and allow the said supplicant to enjoy and use fully and peaceably without making or giving or allowing him to be made or given any disturbance or impediment in any way to the contrary in body nor in goods, but if his body or any of his goods not confiscated are or were for this taken, seized, arrested, or impeded, to give or have given each in law to him be completely delivered.</p>
  
  <p>And so that this will be a firm thing and stable forever we have had placed our seal to these present Except in other things our law and to the other in everything. Given at Rouen in the month of April the year of grace 1423 And the first of our reign. So signed by the King at the Relation of the council.</p>

<p>Pierre Terry was a tailor living in Facquembergue, a town in the north of France. On the 15th of January 1422, he traveled around his town as well as Closquans, running different errands. The area had received a large snowfall the night before, and the ground was covered in snow and ice with frigid air blowing around. While running his errands, Terry used a stick with three-pointed iron tips on the bottom to help him move around in the current conditions. As he walked down the road back towards his home, he ran into many young boys throwing snow at one another, playing in the cold weather. One boy in particular, Pierre le Rat, used a wooden shovel to toss snow at other children as well as those passing by. Le Rat shouted at those walking down the street, telling them that he was ready to toss snow on anyone who passed. Terry, in response to the shouts from le Rat, asked to be left alone. He was struggling to return home after his errands, and at his age and feeling sick with the cold, he did not want any snow thrown on him. Despite Terry‚Äôs request, le Rat threw snow at the old man. When the boy attempted to throw more, Terry lifted his stick up in the air to defend himself, and they exchanged a few blows until he accidentally hit le Rat in the head with one of the iron tips. Le Rat‚Äôs wound was poorly taken care of by doctors, and the boy died 15 days later. Terry, after hearing about the death of le Rat, left the country out of fear of the consequences. It is from his exile that Terry requested his pardon. In it, he says that this is the only horrible thing he has ever done in his life and that he is a good man who was overcome with ‚Äúhot blood.‚Äù Terry additionally made peace with le Rat‚Äôs family and friends after the killing. His pardon was granted on the condition that he make a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Boulogne.   </p>
