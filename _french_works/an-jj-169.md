Charles etc. We make known to all present and in the future we have received the humble supplication of the relatives and close family of Jehan Hanon, poor man, varlet, shoemaker, living in Paris, containing that sixteen or seventeen years ago or thereabouts he took by marriage Huguecte his wife with whom he has been well and honestly by the good counsel of good life that he did up until eight years or thereabouts when the said Huguecte led him a very bad life, leaving him multiple times for one or two months without knowing where she was nor who held her company as she should and was held to do but was held with some ribalds for whose holding in love she did many small purchases and obliged herself towards many people so for the said cause and in default of payment she was for a very long time prisoner for many times without having any good will nor obedience to her said husband but had told him many times in demonstrating her bad will that she would go to Bordeaux and that she wished that her children that she had had with him would become toads and that one day she would make him die a bad death. And at the same time the said Hanon her husband who always had good will to treat her and put her to a good life for his honor and for hers to bring her to retreat many times with him and to pardon as much as he could her misdeeds and sins and lend her gold and silver so that she had no more reason to return to her sins nor to leave his company, the which gold and silver, in persevering and demonstrating her bad will, she gave and loaned to her ribalds who several times at her request set out to injure him in his body. And in fact three of these said ribalds who are said to be of the court of the Official of Paris beat, wounded, and lost his legs everything else in the street of the Prêcheur in Les Halles of Paris and injured very badly and so much that several times he was in the way of being beaten to death. And it was so that after these things were done the Monday 13th day of July last past around seven hours after dinner [midday] that the said Hanon was at the home of his Master in Paris where he worked at his said craft of shoemaking, he was leaving to go to see his said wife who was at the hôtel de la Roche in Paris where she stayed because she never came towards him, the which having come to the said hôtel had called at one of the doors of the said hôtel and such that one of the daughters of the said marriage came to open the door and then he asked her to call her to talk to him and this one called by the said girl who said to her that her father her husband demanded her and wanted to talk to her, to the which words her said mother came and she having come the said Hanon her husband said to her “are you there” “yeah” she said “how are you [formal] doing” to the which he responded “you [formal] hardly know well you never come to see me if I don’t come to see you” to which his said wife responded very bawdily “joy I make to come to you that you weren’t at your master’s place” and the said Hanon said to her “is that all that you know.” And for this he, as if completely drunk, angry, and moved by her responses and by the things before said and by the bad life that she had led him and led for all the time above said and also that she had deserted his honor and livelihood by intention and troubled blood he, tempted by the enemy, hit the said Huguecte his wife with a small knife that he had two blows, one on the side and the other in the belly, by the which blows soon enough afterwards she went from life to death For reason of which deed this Hanon was gone for some time and afterwards returned and was taken and made prisoner in the Castle of La Motte at Luzarches where he has been for three months and still is in great poverty and misery and in the way to miserably finish his days If on this is not to him on this [sic] imparted our grace and mercy as the said supplicants say, Requesting humbly that as in all other cases the said Jehan Hanon has always been of good life, renown, and honest conversation without ever before having been taken, accused, nor convicted of any villainous act, blame, or reproach, we with this our grace and mercy wishing benignly to succor him, For which we considering the things above said and the long detention in prison that he has already suffered, wishing to this party mercy to be preferred to the rigor of justice, to the said Jehan Hanon in the case above said have acquitted, remitted, and pardoned, and by these present with special grace, full power, and Royal authority, we acquit, remit, and pardon the deed and case above said with all penalty, offence, and fine, corporal, criminal, and civil in which for occasion of the things above said he could have incurred against us and justice and we restore him to his good fame and renown in the country and to his goods not confiscated, satisfaction done to the adverse party civilly only if it is not yet done. And we impose on this perpetual silence on our procurer as long as the said Jehan Hanon will be held to make a pilgrimage to Notre Dame du Puy and have a mass celebrated in honor of Notre Dame and for the soul of the said deceased and others who have died during the feast of Easter next coming. ~~ So given in commandment by these same present to the Bailli of Senlis and to all our other Justices present and to come or to their and to each of them as appertains to them that by our present grace, remission, and pardon, have suffered and let this Jehan Hanon enjoy and use fully and peacefully without any more for this in future burden, molest, or impede him in any manner or constraint.

  <h2 class="essays-title">Summary</h2>
    <div class = "essat-content">
      <p>Jehan Hanon was a poor shoemaker from Paris who applied for a pardon for his crime against his wife. Between 16 and 17 years before this plea, he married Huguecte. Hanon was a faithful and good husband to her until eight years into the marriage when Huguecte began to cause problems in the marriage. She would leave Hanon for months at a time without telling him where she went.</p>
      
      <p>According to Hanon, she even wished that their children could be turned into toads. This was also when she began threatening his life.</p>
      
      <p>As Hanon was being an honorable husband, Huguecte continued to cause problems. She hired some of the men she had been spending time with to seek her husband out and beat him. He was beaten to the verge of death in the street of Prêcheur in Les Halles of Paris.</p>
      
      <p>After this incident, Hanon was at his Master's home in Paris where he worked as a shoemaker. He went to see Huguecte in the hôtel de la Roche, where she was staying instead of with her husband. Unlike the English word for hotel, the French hôtel is like a large fancy house that multiple people live in at once. One of their daughters answered the door when Hanon arrived and went to fetch Huguecte. When she confronted Hanon at the door, she was upset with him for spending time at his Master's place.</p>
      
      <p>Hanon was drunk, and in a fit of rage, he remembered all the misdeeds that he had suffered at the hands of his wife. He stabbed her twice, and she died.</p>
      
      <p>Hanon was taken to prison in the Castle of La Motte at Luzarches and had been there for three months at the time of the letter. Finally, the letter requests that he be pardoned for his crime based on his previous honorable life. His actions toward his wife were framed as an outlier, as he had put up with her bad behavior for at least eight years. Hanon requested pardon from the King and he was granted pardon in October of 1416.</p>

    <h3 class="essay-title">Medieval Motherhood</h3>
    <div class="essay-author">By Corissa Ross, Hendrix College '24</div>
    <div class="essay-content">
      <p>In the Middle Ages, being a wife was difficult; so was being a mother. In the Good Wife's Guide, there is a section dedicated to motherhood. All wives were expected to become mothers. All aspects of child rearing were left up to the mother. The knowledge and fears about childbearing and raising children all stemmed from women, as the husbands were expected to continue working.</p>
      
      <p>However, some mothers had to return to work for the family if they were of middle or lower class. Conflict arose between wives and husbands in this scenario, especially if the husband accused the wife of neglecting her duties as a mother. This is evident when Huguecte is accosted by her husband for abandoning her children and wishing they were toads. Other than being a faithful wife, motherhood was the most important job for Medieval women.</p>

    <h3 class="essay-title">Social Expectations in Medieval Marriage</h3>
    <div class="essay-author">By Corissa Ross, Hendrix College '24</div>
    <div class="essay-content">
      <p>Women in the Middle Ages were expected to be fully devoted to their husbands, and fully devoted to God. A publication called the Good Wife's Guide began as a collection of advice, personality traits, and duties of a good Parisian wife. The three main concerns were morality, domestic life, and hosting. The wife's goal was meant to be a "moral, obedient, and attentive wife." When Huguecte left her husband, one of the reasons he gives for being so angry at her is that she went to stay with other men in the Hôtel.</p>
      
      <p>In addition, women who were married were expected to have children and raise them. These expectations were ingrained in all social aspects of the Middle Ages. There was an emphasis on monogamy and chastity in order for wives to please their husbands and God. In fact, it was believed that the commandment for women to be obedient to their husbands came directly from God. Husbands had the upper hand in the relationship, and often had legal privileges if he did not approve of his wife's behavior.</p>

    <h3 class="essay-title">Male and Female Honor</h3>
    <div class="essay-author">By Corissa Ross, Hendrix College '24</div>
    <div class="essay-content">
      <p>Many pardon letters were written to heighten the honorable qualities of the petitioner in order to make him or her appear worthy of a pardon. Men were often insulted in the public sphere, and judgements were made based on their honesty and worth. A lot of violence between men was based on reactions to being dishonored by someone publicly. When a man felt his masculinity affronted, his deepest honor, violence was likely.</p>
      
      <p>Women had strict social rules that included avoiding eye contact with people in public. They were taught to avoid perception because it could be misconstrued as promiscuity. Virginity, beauty, wealth, and faith to her husband were the most important qualities of honor in a woman. "Loose" women were frowned upon. Violence involving women were often perpetrated by men, with women as accomplices or instigators.</p>

    <h3 class="essay-title">Money and Class</h3>
    <div class="essay-author">By Corissa Ross, Hendrix College '24</div>
    <div class="essay-content">
      <p>Husbands were expected to be the bread winners of their households. They were the entire financial security for their wives in the Middle Ages. This ideal continued into the social expectations of marriage. Men were supposed to marry women who were of the same social class in order to avoid unnecessary disagreements. A man's honor was tied directly to his ability to provide for his family. Sometimes, wives would abandon their husbands if they felt they were not being taken care of. This was a blow to both of their honors.</p>
      
      <p>The 100 years' war was also occurring at this time. This war heavily affected peasants in Paris. These wars destroyed crops, homes, and livelihoods of many low-class workers in the area. For this reason, many worked less than they may have needed in order to make a living.</p>

    <h3 class="essay-title">Witchcraft</h3>
    <div class="essay-author">By Corissa Ross, Hendrix College '24</div>
    <div class="essay-content">
      <p>In Jehan's testimony, he recalls an incident where his wife wished that her children would turn into toads. This allegation of witchcraft and cursing would not have been taken lightly in the Middle Ages. Witchcraft was often attributed to women during this time. The involvement of witchcraft and child rearing was a big concern.</p>
      
      <p>People in this time were expected to be devoted to God. Any involvement with witchcraft was associated with the devil and often saw harsh interrogation and punishment. This was also a time when cursing could be seen as having actual physical harm. If Huguecte wished that her children turned into some sort of animal, her husband would be frightened. This is especially the case because she would have been responsible for caretaking and parenting of the children.</p>
