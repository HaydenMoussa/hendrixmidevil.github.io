# About Medieval Crime

Medieval Crime is a collective of artists dedicated to exploring the darker side of medieval history through visual art. Our work examines historical crime scenes, judicial proceedings, and punishment systems from the Middle Ages, bringing these historical moments to life through a blend of accurate research and artistic interpretation.

## Our Vision

We aim to educate viewers about historical justice systems while creating compelling artwork that challenges contemporary perspectives on crime and punishment. By looking to the past, we gain insight into how societies have evolved in their treatment of criminal behavior.

## Our Artists

Our collective features talented artists from diverse backgrounds, each bringing their unique artistic vision to medieval crime scenes and stories. From illuminated manuscript styles to modern interpretations, our artists create work that is both historically informed and visually striking.
